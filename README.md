## Summary

Welcome to Petful. Petful is a (virtual) adoption center where you can entire a virtual queue
and simulate the wonderful experience of waiting in line at the dog pound or wherever else you 
pick up adopted animals. You'll only have five seconds to decide if you're going to change animals'
life forever before you're kicked back to the end of the line, so think fast!


### The adoption process
----------------
<p>When waiting in line to adopt these pets you will be able to see current pets availiable.</p>
<p>Every 5 seconds the person in the front of the line change so make sure to pay attention.</p>
<p>When it is your turn the option to adopt either a dog, a cat or both pets will present itself. You still will be on the timer so make it count.</p>
<p>Once you submit you'll be removed from the front of the line and the pets will be shipped to you.</p>

## Notes

This client continually updates in a set interval as the queue rotates. The client does not simulate other 
user behavior, i.e., users in the queue other than yourself will not adopt any pets.
